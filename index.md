## Welcome to Lorin's Site

Hi, this is Lorin Li, and I am currently workly in the area of data modelling for personl bank. 

Now I am exploring new machine learning methodology and other advanced analytical solutions for solving real world problems, such as how to predict credit card customer's churn rate, and how to estimate the potential risk for new loan applicants to be default after 1 or 2 years.

I will try to introduce my knowhow on personal banking risk score modelling, but would like to test more fancy methodologies (rather than Logistic Regression which have been used in industry for decades...) and see if we can find a better solution.

Also, I am curious about any use cases that succeed in other industries. So please kind share your idea and let's rock the brain by more dicussion.

Hope you can have fun here!
